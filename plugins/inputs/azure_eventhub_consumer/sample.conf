  ## How often to checkpoint to azure blob storage. The longer the duration, the more checkpointing
  ## happens in-memory and could lead to data loss. Checkpointing to blob storage on the other hand,
  ## is slower but the tradeoff is data durability.
  ##  example: azure_blob_checkpoint_interval = "-1" This means checkpoint on every read
  # azure_blob_checkpoint_interval = "5m"

  # prefetch_count = 1000

  # enqueue_time_as_metric_timestamp = "true"
